    Operators in Javascript
    - Operartor is an object in computer programming.
    - It comprises of data and logic
    - Operartor stores data in operands and defines logic using an entity or keyword.
            x + y       => x, y are operands
                        => + is an entity
    ++ Based on how many operands an operator can handle they are classified into 3.
        Unary   : 1 operand
        Binary  : 2 operands
        Ternary : 3 operands
    - Unary Operators:
        x++, x--, ++x, --x
    - Binary Operartors:
        x+y
        x/y
    - Ternary Operators: 
        ? : 
        (condition) ? true_operations : false_operations
    // see 03_ternary operators ex2.html
    
    ++ Javascript operators are again classified into various types based on what type of values they return.
        - Arithmetic Operators
        - Comparision Operators
        - Logical Operartors
        - Assignment Operators
        - Bitwise Operators
        - Special Operators
    
    ++ Arithmetic Operators
        +   Addition
        -   Subtraction
        *   Multiplication
        /   Division
        %   Modulus
        **  Exponent
        ++  Increment
        --  Decrement
    
    - Javascript provides Math object to handle mathematic operations
        - Math.PI
        - Math.cos()
        - Math.tan()
        - Math.sqrt()
        - Math.random()
        - Math.pow() ...etc.
        
    + Addition: It returns the sum of given operands.
        string + string     = string
        string + number     = string
        string + boolean    = string
        number + number     = number
        number + boolean    = number
        boolean + boolean   = number
    
    - Subtraction: It returns the difference of given operands
        number - number     = number
        number - boolean    = number
        string - string     = NaN
        boolean - string    = NaN
    
    * Multiplication: It returns the product of given values

    / Division: It returns quotient
    
    % Modulus: It returns remainder

    ** Exponent: It returns power (left_operand raised to the power of right_operand) 
    
    Post Increment : First Assignment then Increment
        x = 10;
        y = x++;
    Pre Increment : First Increment then Assignment
        x = 10;
        y = ++x;
    Post Decrement : First Assignment then Decrement
        x = 10;
        y = x--;
    Pre Decrement : First Decrement then Assignment
        x = 10;
        y = --x;
    
    ++ Assignment Operators : They can perform specific operation and assign result to existing value.
        += 
        -= 
        *= 
        /= 

    ++ Comparision Operators
        ==      Equal to
        ===     Identical Equal | Strict Equal
        !=      Not Equal
        >       Greater than
        >=      Greater than or equal to
        <       Less than
        <=      Less than or equal to
    
    FAQ: What is the difference b/w == and === ?
    Ans: == It can compare 2 different types of variables.
         === It can compare 2 same types of variables only.
    
    ++ Logical Operators
        && [AND] : It returns true if all expressions evaluate to true
        || [OR] : It returns true if anyone of the expressions evaluate to true
        ! [NOT] : It returns true if expressions evaluate to false and vice versa

    ++ Special Operators
        Ternary operator ? :
        typeof : It returns the type of value stored in the reference
        instanceof : It returns boolean true if given object is instance of specific class.
        delete : It can remove any key/property from an object.
        in : It is used to verify key/property in an object.
        of : It is used to verify all values in an iterator.
        void : It discards the return value of any expression.
        new : It is dynamic memory allocating operator.
                var products = new Array(); // dynamic memory allocation
                var products = [] ; // static memory allocation
                var date = new Date(); // dynamic memory allocation

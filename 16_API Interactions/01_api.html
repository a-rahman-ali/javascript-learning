    API Interactions

    * What is Distributed Computing?
    - Distributed computing allows 2 different applications running on 2 different machines can share information between them.
    - Distributed computing allows 2 different applications running in 2 different processes of same machine to share information.

    Distributed Computing Technologies
    - CORBA(Common Object Request Broker Architecture)
    - DCOM(Distributed Component Object Model)
    - RMI(Remote Method Invocation)  
    - EJB(Enterprise Java Beans)
    - Web Services (Common in all the services)
    - Remoting etc...

    Web Service Specifications
    - SOAP(Service Oriented Architecture Protocol)
        Consumer makes XML request - Provider sends XML response
        
    - REST(Representational State Transfer)
        Consumer Query request - Provider sends XML response | JSON response

    - JSON(Javascript Object Notation)
        Consumer sends JSON request - Provider sends JSON response.

    Features of JSON:
    - Light weight
    - Faster
    - Not infected by virus
    - Can't be blocked by FireWall
    - Easy to transport
    - Compatible with every browser

    -> API uses both JSON and XML
    How Javascript can handle API requests?
    Ans: Javascript uses "XmlHttpRequest" object
        jQuery      : $.ajax()      => XMLHttpRequest
        Angular     : HttpClient    => XMLHttpRequest
        React       : Axios         => XMLHttpRequest
        Javascript  : Fetch         => XMLHttpRequest

    -Javascript uses a Promise called fetch() to communicate with API.
    - Promise is a function that handles specified functions with set of callbacks.
    - Callbacks handle various functionalities depending on state and situation.
    - Fetch is a Javascript promise which handles communication with API and returns data if successful and returns error status if failed.

    Syntax: 
        fetch('url').then(onSuccess).throw(onFailure).catch();
        // still some more functions do exist
    
    Ex: Working with fetch() and fetching data from JSON file

    1. Create a new folder in a project, say "data"
    2. Add  new file, say data.json
    3. Access in html page

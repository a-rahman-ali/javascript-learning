    Javascript OOPs

    - Real world project development uses various programming systems
        1. POPS (Process Oriented Programming System)
        2. OBPS (Object Based Programming System)
        3. OOPS (Object Oriented Programming System)
    
    POPS (Process Oriented Programming System)
    - It supports low level features
    - IT can directly interact with hardware
    - It is faster
    - It uses less memory
    Ex: C, Pascal, COBOL
    - Reusability Issues
    - Extensibility Issues
    - Dynamic Memory

    OBPS (Object Based Programming System)
    - It supports Reusability
    - It supports Dynamic Memory
    - Limited Extensibility
    - Not loosely coupled
    - More memory than POPS
    - Security Issues
    Ex: Javascript, VB

    OOPS (Object Oriented Programming System)
    - It supports Reusability, Dynamic Memory, Extensibility
    - Security
    - Can't directly interact with hardware
    - Slow
    - More memory usage

    Ex: Java, C++, C#, TypeScript

    Note : Javascript is not an OOP language. It supports only a few features of OOPs
    
    History of OOP
    - Alan Kay in early 1960's introduced the concept of "Object" into computer programming.
    - 1967 Johan Ole, Kristian Nygard developed first OOP language "SIMULA" 
        [Code Reusability]
        SIMULA 67
    
    - Trygve introduced the concept of code seperation. He introduced a framework called "MVC" [Model-View-Controller]
    - 1972 1st OOP language "Smalltalk" was introduced.
    - In early 1975 - C++
    - In early 1990 - Java
    - In early 2003 - .NET language, TypeScript

                Javascript Modules
    - A Module is a set of functions, values and classes.
    - Module resembles a library for building application.
    - Javascript uses various Module systems
        a) Common JS
        b) Require JS
        c) UMD(Universal Module Distribution)
        d) AMD(Asynchronous Module Definition)
    
    - By default with node.js you will get "Common JS" module system.

    - Every Javascript file is a module.
    - Module comprises of functions, variables and classes.
    - Every member in a module is accessible only within the module.
    - If you want a function of class to be accessed outside the module, then you have to mark it as "export".

    Syntax:
        export function Name(){}
        export class Name{}
    
    - Every module can have one "default" member.
    - Default member loads automatically.

    Syntax:
        export default function Name(){}
    - You can import the member in a page by using "import" statement
        import { functionName } from '../library/module.js';    // non-default members
        import functionName from '../library/module.js';        // default members
        import functionName, { functionName } from '../library/module.js';

    - Modules are configured with the type as "module"
        "script type="module" src="../library/module.js"> / script >"
    
                Javascript Classes
    - In OOP languages, class is a program template.
    - A template comprises of sample data and logic which you can customize according to your requirements and implement.
    - Class is reffered as model when it is mapping with data.
    - Class is reffered as entity when it is mapping with business. 
    - Class is a blueprint for designing templates.
    - In JavaScript OOP class can contain only
        a) Property
        b) Method
        c) Accessor
        d) Constructor
    
    - Class is a program template.
    - Class have behavior of 
        a) Model
        b) Entity
        c) Blue Print
    - Class is reffered as model when it is mapping with data requirements.
    - Class is reffered as entity when it is mapping with business requirements.
    - Class is reffered as blueprint for designing templates.

    How to define a class?
    - class is defined by using 2 techniques:
        a) Class declaration
        b) Class expression
    
    - Class declaration allows to configure class with a set of specific members.
        Syntax:
            class className{

            }
    - Class expression allows to configure memory for class where the class can change according to state and situation.
        Syntax:
            var className = class{};

    - Every Javascript class can contain only following members:
            a) Property
            b) Method
            c) Accessor
            d) Constructor
    - FAQ: Can we define variable in class?
    Ans: No, we can't define variable in class.

    - FAQ: Why variable is not allowed as a class member?
    Ans: variable is immutable. Class can't contain immutable members.

    - FAQ: Then how is data stored inside a class?
    Ans: By using Property.

    Syntax:
        class className{
            Property = value;
        }
    FAQ: What is the difference between Property and variable?
    Ans: Variable is immutable and property is mutable.

    FAQ: Can we define function in class?
    Ans: No, we can't define function in class.

    FAQ: How functionality is defined in class?
    Ans: By using Method.

    Syntax:
        class className{
            functionName(){}
        }
    FAQ: What is the difference between Method and function?
    Ans: Method is a function inside a class. Method is mutable and function is immutable.

    - A class method can have variables and functions.
    Syntax:
        class className{
            functionName(){
                variable = value;
                functionName(){}
            }
        }
    
    Class Members
    a) Property 
    - It is used to store data.
    - It is mutable
    - It can store any type of data, Primitive or Non-Primitive.
    - You can access the class members by using instance of class.
    - Instance is a object that refers to memory where all class memers are loaded.
    
    - You can assign any value into property dynamically by using instance of that class.
    
    b) Accessor 
    - It is used to give a fine grained control over the property.
    - It can control read and write features for any property.
    - Every property can have 2 accessors
        a) get      [getter used to read value from property]
        b) set      [setter used to write value into property]
    
    - You can also use accessors to access any member of class from a multilevel hierarchy.

    c) Method
    - All method features are same as function.
    - Parameterized.
    - Paramterless.
    - Arrow
    - Rest parameters
    - Recursion.
    - Return Type etc...
    Syntax:
        class ClassName{
            methodName(){
                // code
            }
        }
    
    d) Constructor
    - Constructor is a software design pattern.
    - It is a creational pattern.
    - It is the process of creating an instance for class.
    - Constructor is a special type of sub-routine used for instantiation[Creating Object].
    - Every class has a default constructor.
    - You can add a constructor explicitly.
    - Constructor is a special type of method[subroutine] that exectues automatically at the time of object creation.
    - Javascript constructor is of Anonymous type.

    Syntax:
        class MyClass{
            constructor(){
                // code
            }

        }
        // instantiation
        let obj = new MyClass; // MyClass() is not necessary

    - If constructor is parameterized then you have to mention about constructor at the time of instantiation.
    - You have to pass values into constructor at the time of allocating memory for object.
        let obj = new MyClass(params);
    - JavaScript constructor can't be overloaded.
    - You can't restrict constructor.

    Code Reusability:
    - You can reuse and extend code by 2 techniques.
        a) Aggregation
        b) Inheritance
    - Aggregation:
        - It is the process of access members of obe class in another without rewriting the code.
        - It is the process of reusing without configuring any relation between class.
        - It is often called as "Object-to-Object" communication.
        - It is also known as "Has-A-Relation".

    - Inheritance:
        - It is the process that allows to access members of one class in another without an object.
        - You can configure relation between class.
        - You can access the members of existing class in current class by using "extends".
        - Current class can extend the existing class.
        - Existing class is known as "Super" class.
        - Current class is known as "Derived" class.
        - You can access the members of Super class by using "super" keyword.
        - It is also known as "Is-A-Relation".

    OOP Rule:
    - When you create an object for derived class which is extending super class, 
      then as per OOP rules first base class constructor is called and followed by derived class constructor.
    
    - But JavaScript doesn't support the above rule.
    - You have to explicitly design the derived class constructor such that it calls the base class constructor.

     // see 07_DOM_demo.html
    - whenever the positionof element changes in page. You have to update its index in the logic also.
    - To overcome this issue, you can use document methods like
        - document.getElementById()
        - document.getElementByName()
        - document.getElementByClassName()
        - document.getElementByTagName()
    - You can also use reference name for elements. You have to configure the complete parent and child node hierarchy in order to access any child element.
     // see 08_DOM_demo.html
    
    DOM Manipulation
     - Access and use HTML
     - Configure and Modify their data and styles
     - Removing Elements.
     // see 11_DOM_demo4.html

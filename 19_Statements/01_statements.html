    Javascript Statements
    
    - In computer programming statement is used to control the execution flow.
    - Javascript statement are classified into 
        1. Selection Statement
            if, else, switch, case, default
        2. Iteration Statement
            for...in, for...of
        3. Looping Statement
            while, for, do while
        4. Jumping Statement
            break, continue, return
        5. Exception Handling Statement
            try, catch, throw, finally
    
    ++ Selection Statements
    - Selection Statements are used in decision making
    - The keywords are
        if, else, switch, case, default
    
    if select:
    - It is a decision making statement that executes one set of statements when condition is true
        and the another when condition is false
    - If select can be defined in various forms
        a) Forward Jump : It is a decision making where there will not be any alternative
        b) Simple Decision
        c) Multilevel Decision
        d) Mutliple Choices

        ** // see 02_fwd jump.html for an example implementation
        a) Forward Jump : It is a decision making where there will not be any alternative
            Syntax:
                if(condition){
                    statement(s) to be executed when condition is true;
                }
        b) Simple Decision : It is a decision making which comprises of one alternative for given condition.
            Syntax:
                if(condition){
                    statement(s) to be executed when condition is true;
                }
                else{
                    statement(s) to be executed when condition is false;
                }
                
                It is generally called as - "if and else clause" 

            Note: Always don't try to write multiple conditions in one line
            If you're using multiple conditions in one "if()" container then, error result will display same for all errors.
            // see 03_simple decision.html 
        c) Multilevel Decision : It is a decision making which comprises of multiple alternatives for given condition.
                Syntax:
                    if(condition-1){
                        if(condition-2){
                            statement(s) to be executed when both conditions are true;
                        }
                        else{
                            statement(s) to be executed when condition-2 is false;
                        }
                    }
                    else{
                        statement(s) to be executed when condition-1 is false;
                    }
            // see 04_multilevel decision.html
        d) Mutliple Choices : It is a decision making which comprises of multiple alternatives for given condition.
                Syntax:
                    if(condition-1){
                        statement(s) to be executed when condition-1 is true;
                    }
                    else if(condition-2){
                        statement(s) to be executed when condition-2 is true;
                    }
                    else if(condition-3){
                        statement(s) to be executed when condition-3 is true;
                    }
                    else{
                        statement(s) to be executed when all conditions are false;
                    }
            // see 05_multiple choices.html

        Switch Selector:
        - Switch is used to control/interrupt the flow of electrons
        - In electronics switches are of various types
                a) Push button
                b) Toggle switch
                c) Selector
                d) Joystick switch etc...
        - Selector switch is used in programming to handle multiple conditions.
        - It select only the block that matches the given condition.
        - It reduces the number of conditions to one condition and selects the block that matches the given condition.
        - It reduces the compile time and complexity.
                Syntax:
                    switch(condition){
                        case condition-1:
                            statement(s) to be executed when condition-1 is true;
                            jump_statement;
                        case condition-2:
                            statement(s) to be executed when condition-2 is true;
                            jump_statement;
                        case condition-3:
                            statement(s) to be executed when condition-3 is true;
                            jump_statement;
                        default:
                            statement(s) to be executed when all conditions are false;
                            jump_statement; 
                    }

        FAQ's:
        1. Can we define switch without default ?
        Ans: Yes

        2. Can we define default above or between case?
        Ans: Yes.

        3. Can we define case without break?
        Ans: Yes. If break is not defined then it will continue with the next case and will stop when next break occurs or switch ends.

        4. What is break?
        Ans: It is a jump statement used to terminate the block.

        5. Can we use "return" as jump statement for switch case?
        Ans: Yes.

        6. What is difference between break and return?
        Ans: break will terminate the block, but it will still keep the compiler active.
             return will terminate compiler and exectuion.
        
        7. Can we define switch case string type ? What must be the type for case?
        Ans: Yes. case can use only
                    a) number
                    b) string
                    c) boolean
                    d) an expression that returns number, string, boolean.
        
        8. How to define case for range of values?
        Ans: By using boolean type expression.
             If expression's case is boolean then switch value must be boolean.
             We can define case for range of values by using true in switch and having the case expressions returning boolean values.

        ++ Looping Control Statements
        - Looping is the process of executing a set of statements repeatedly until the given condition is satisfied.
        - Looping comprises of 
                a) Initialization
                b) Condition
                c) Counter increment/decrement
        - Initialization defines when to start
        - Condition defines when to stop
        - Counter defines how to proceed

        - Loops are defined by 
                a) for
                b) while
                c) do while
        for loop:
        - It is a looping control statement used by developers when exact nomber of iterations are known and iteration count won't change dynamically.
            Syntax:
                for(initialization; condition; counter){
                    statement(s) to be executed;
                }
        - You can define initialization, condition and counter outside of for() but it must have cofiguration for all 3
            Syntax:
                initialization;
                for(; ;){
                    if(condition){
                        statement(s) to be executed when condition is true;
                    }
                    counter;
                }
        - You can configure for with any counter [increment or decrement].
        - Modern Best Practice is using iterations.

        while loop:
        - It is used when we are not sure about the number of iterations.
        - Iteration counter will change dynamically.
        - It can start loop only when condition is true.
                Syntax:
                    while(condition){
                        statement(s) to be executed when condition is true;
                        counter;
                    }

        do while loop:
        - It is similar to while loop but can execute statements atleast once even when the condition is false.
                Syntax:
                    do{
                        statement(s) to be executed when condition is true;
                        counter;
                    }while(condition);

        - TASK: Write a Javascript program to convert number into words.
        
        ++ Iteraion Statements
        - Iteration is a Software Design Pattern used to read elements from a collection in sequential order.
        - Iteration doesn't require initialization, condition and counter.
        - Iterations are defined in Javascript by using 
                for...in
                for...of
        for...in: It can read and return all properties.
        for...of: It can read and return all values.
        - You can terminate the loops and iterators by using jump statements.
                a) break
                b) continue
                c) return
        break: It terminates the block, but will stay in function
        continue: It terminates the current iteration and continues with the next iteration.
                  It skips the counter and continues to next.
        return : It terminates the execution.

        TASK: Try implementing 4 digit PIN validation. It should block after 3 unsuccessful attempts.

        ++ Exception Handling Statements:
        - Exception Handling is a Software Design Pattern used to handle errors and exceptions.
        - In computer programming developers will come across 2 types of errors.
                    1. Compile Time Errors
                    2. Run Time Errors
        - Compiler time errors are syntax errors; due to which the program fails to compile and unable to print output.
        - Runtime errors: Program is compiled successfully without errors.
                          When user interacts with program and provides input which is not understandable to compiler then it leads to runtime errors
                          If any runtime errors occurs in a program that leads to abnormal termination.
                          It can be handled by using exception handling statements.
                          It can be handled by using try, catch and finally blocks.
        - Exception Handling is used in computer programming to avoid abnormal termination.
        - Exception Handling in Javascript is managed by following statements
                try     - It is monitoring block        : statement(s) to execute
                catch   - IT is handler block           : It catches the exception
                throw   - It is used to throw the error.
                finally - It contains statements to execute always i.e irrespective of the exception occured or not.
        
        - Exception Handling is very important and useful concept in Javascript but when Javascript is being used with HTML we may not find that much use.

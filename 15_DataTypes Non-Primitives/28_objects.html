    ++ Objects
    - Object is used to keep all related data and logic together.
    - The concept of object was introduced in early 1960's by "Alan Kay".
    - Ole-Johan, Kristian Nygaard introduced the OOPs Concept generally.

    {
        "Key" : "Value",
        "Key" : function(){ }
    }
    - If Javascript is defining n object then every key must be string and value can be of any type.
            {
                Name: "Samsung TV",
                Price: 56000.34,
            }
    - If object contains only data then it is reffered as JSON.
            [Javascript Object Notation]
    - JSON is a format for data.
    - Popular data formats are XML, XML Atom, JSON, JSONP etc.

    - Data is accessed with the reference name of Object name
        tv.Name;                        // getter - read value
        tv.Name = "Samsung LED TV";     // setter - store new value
    - Object enables reusability.
    - [] -- Array
    - {} -- Object
    - [{}, {}, {}] -- Array of Objects

    // See 29_objects example.html, 30_objects ex1.html for examples of objects

    ++ Accessing Data from API
    - Javascript Promises concepts can be used to fetch the data from API
    

    ++ Object with Methods // See 31_objects.html, 32_objects ex2.html
    - Object comprises of related data and logic
    - Data is defined in property and logic in function
            var obj = {
                property: value,
                method: function(){}
            }
    - But JSON is not about functionality, it is about data.
    - Object related properties and methods are accessed within object using "this" keyword.
    - You can access outside by using object name.

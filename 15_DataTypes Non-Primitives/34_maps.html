    ++ Map Type
    - Map type is newly added from ES5+ [ECMA2015]
    - Map is similar to object with Key and Value pair.
    - Map can have keys of any type.
    - Map has implicit iterators for reading keys and values
    - It makes faster than object
    - It provides properties and methods to handle key-value collection.
